# smart-contracts
There are many blockchain systems for writing smart contracts in. I wanted to play around with Ethereum / Solidity smart contracts and learn more about these.

Goals
- Learn Solidity and its syntax/nuances
- Create a template for smart contracts
- Write some custom clauses as per real world scenarios/purposes

Note: I'm not building the blockchain - that will be part of a seperate repo;  I'm using ETH as its widely used. XRP/Corda is also used but I had to pick one, so I did.
